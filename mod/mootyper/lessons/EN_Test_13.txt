Walter wore Wellingtons on wearisome wanderings. Oddly, Olivia offered others oats and onions. Willoughby and Wordsworth wished Windsor well. Ostentatious, outer outrider outraged Orangemen. While Walt washed weft, Wilma whitewashed walls. Oh, obtrusive onlookers overlooked our objections. Overdressed Ottomans ousted overbearing oysters. Wild William wants a wild whimsical willowy wafer. Otto obeyed an obligation of objecting oatmeal. Wistful Wilma watches Wallace write whodunits. Obdurate objector observed obstinate ontologists. Whimsical Walter winked and wooed wise witty Wilma.

Xiaoping xeroxed a photo of a xenophobic Xhosa. X chromosomes exist exclusively in human cells. Xiphophylous, xenopteri and xylolis mean nothing. Xenophobic people have xenophobic extra fears. Xerxes expected extremists to play the xylophone. Xanadu exists in extremely extravagant expressions. Xmas executers expected an experimental Xmas.

"The time has come," the Walrus said, "To talk of many things: Of shoes and ships and sealing wax. Of cabbages and kings. And why the sea is boiling hot. And whether pigs have wings." Lewis Carroll. The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie: deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth: persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. John F. Kennedy. Industrial man, a sentient reciprocating engine having a fluctuating output, coupled to an iron wheel revolving with uniform velocity. And then we wonder why this should be the golden age of revolution and mental derangement. Aldous Huxley. It is impossible to read the daily press without being diverted from reality. You are full of enthusiasm for the eternal verities. Life is worth living. And then out of sinful curiosity you open a newspaper. You are disillusioned and wrecked. Patrick Kavanagh. Well, love is insanity. The ancient Greeks knew that. It is the taking over of a rational and lucid mind by delusion and destruction of self. You lose yourself, you have no power over yourself, you can't even think straight. Marilyn French. Father Time is not always a hard parent, and, though he tarries for none of his children, often lays his hand lightly upon those who have used him well; making them old men and women inexorably enough, but leaving their hearts and spirits young and in full vigour. With such people the gray head is but the impression of the old fellow's hand in giving them his blessing, and every wrinkle but a notch in the quiet calendar of a life spent well. Charles Dickens.
