For a long time, Texie had wanted to study abroad. So he applied and was accepted to go to Finland. Texie did not really know much about the country. He only knew it was somewhere far in the north. He did not know what to expect of his year there. Nevertheless, he packed both his suitcases and left. His first glimpse of Finland was a network of ields. There were also green belts of forest and blue lakes. Well, that looks beautiful, Texie thought to himself. The weather was warm and sunny with a light breeze. Finland seemed to be a rather pleasant place to live. However, Tex did not like local student apartments. Texie gradually adjusted himself to the new country. The people were somehow reserved unlike at home. But once you got to know them, they were just ok. Actually, quite honest and sincere between friends. Texie was happy to make friends with a few Finns. The friendship would last and extend over the sea. Tex learnt the exciting sides of the local culture, too. Sauna was a hot room with a kind of stone stove. One throws water on the stones to release steam. In the winter sauna, you go out to roll in the snow. In the summer sauna, you swim in the blue lakes. And you hit yourself with a bunch of birch twigs. Finns are exceptionally funny, Texie concluded.
