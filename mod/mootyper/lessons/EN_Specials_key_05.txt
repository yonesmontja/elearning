2(x + 4) = 2x + 8 "free@enterprise.com" reads "Free at enterprise dot com". Nesting: (12[5x + y][x + 3]) Summer special: 200 shower units @ $42.50 They paid me three hundred dollars ($300.00). Typing symbols such as $, & and @, is tiresome. The @ symbol is sometimes called the ape-tail, but really it is short hand for the word "at". Use [ ]--not brackets--when you insert a word or phrase into a quotation. The ampersand (&) is not correctly used in place of the word "and" in a sentence. Ellipsis ( ... ) or ( . . . ) is used to show that something has been omitted. Brackets can also indicate multiplication: 2(5) = 10 The company is called "Brown & Jones, Solicitors". In HTML coding, &amp; is used for &. The keys [Enter] and [Shift] are used frequently. 50% of 100 is 50. 25% of 200 is also 50. How much is 10% of 500? "Great Expectations" was written by Charles Dickens [1812-1870]. If (inp(1) and inp(2)) or (inp (3)), then (pin(4'5'6)). If [shift]=(true) then call=tip.exe or call=tap.exe end sub. Sales tax is 17.5%. Does this mean that for every $100 you spend, $17.50 is taken for no vale added. I shall never learn & or @ or as fluently as the letter keys, as hard as I may try. Chording is pressing keys simultaneously, such as [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Del] keys needed to log on to some operating systems. Information in parentheses (like this, for example) are often examples. [Ctrl] key is the Control key, which was used in the days of teletype systems with the [C] key as a system IRQ. (09) 55 555 could be a Finnish telephone number. Square brackets are often used to indicate a key; such as [enter], for example. Some people claim that Pascal (1623-1662) discovered the triangle of binomial coefficients. Chemists use square brackets to indicate concentration, so [acid] means concentration of acid. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is arguably the most important physicist and mathematician in modern history. Surds are expressions (such as the square root of 7, or the cube root of 42) which cannot be evaluated exactly.

I am going to write an e-mail to Tom. His address is tom@email.com. Or is it tom@email.net? You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you. (Eric Hoffer) In 1969 the price of 5 kg of flour was $0.75. In 1970 the price was increased 15% to $0.86. In 1971, the 1970 price was decreased by 5%. What was the price of 5 kg of flour in 1971? $0.82, right? If you don't like typing the @ or & symbols, you can set up an auto-correct function to change "at//" into @ and "an//" into &. In the IRC protocol, @ is the symbol for a channel operator. IRC also uses the user@host form for identifying and banning users. Default mode switching can be achieved by pressing [mode] + [shift] with a key-press chord. The ampersand & is often, although not necessarily correctly, used, but really it should never be used in formal texts. Instead of writing "Cats & dogs" write "Cats and dogs." Square brackets [these] are mainly used in computer programming and to insert a clarifying word or phrase into a quotation. Example: "[P.D. James' fictional detective] Dalgleish is both a poet and a policeman." Stephanie had $40. Her mother gave her another $30 and her aunt $10 to buy a shirt. The one Stephanie wants costs $54.99. If she got a 20% discount, how much would it cost? "Why I came here, I know not; where I shall go it is useless to enquire - in the midst of myriads of the living & the dead worlds, stars, systems, infinity, why should I be anxious about an atom?" (Lord Byron) Chinese calligraphy has acquired western symbols, including $ and @, although linguistic purists resist this trend vigorously. Psychologists have found that short hand symbols such as $ and & are not as difficult for dyslexic patients to read as normal text.
