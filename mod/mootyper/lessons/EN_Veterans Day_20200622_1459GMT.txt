What is Veterans Day and why do we celebrate it?\nVeterans Day honors all of those who have served the country in war or peace — dead or alive — although it's largely intended to thank living veterans for their sacrifices. It was originally called Armistice Day, commemorating the end of World War I.

1 What is Veterans Day?
/**/
Ever wonder why Veterans day is on the 11th and does not change? World War I ended on the 11th month on the 11th day on the 11th hour.\nToday I saw a man selling poppies stop a lady and asked if he could re-position her poppy. While doing so he told that lady she should wear the poppy on their right side; the red represents the blood of all those who gave their lives, the black represents the mourning of those who didn't have their loved ones return home, and the green leaf represents the grass and crops growing and future prosperity after the war destroyed so much. The leaf should be position at 11 o'clock to represent the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the time that World War I formally ended. He was worried that younger generations wouldn't understand this and his generation wouldn't be around for much longer to teach them. We must remember those from our current wars too!\nFor those that do not know, the eleventh day of the eleventh month is Veterans Day! I copied this from someone else. Please do the same to pass this knowledge on to those who don't know the meaning and who care enough to know.
