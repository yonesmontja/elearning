THE BAT AND THE WEASELS\n\nA Bat, trying to fly one day, fell to the ground, and a Weasel caught him. The Bat begged the Weasel not to kill him.\n\n"There is nothing I hate like a bird," said the Weasel; "I always kill them."\n\n"But I am not a bird," said the Bat, as he folded his wings close to his sides; "birds don't come tumbling down as I did; and besides, don't you see my little smooth head, and my ears?"\n\n"Yes, yes," said the Weasel, "I did not notice them at first. I see, you are a mouse"; so he let the Bat go.\n\nSome time after, the Bat took another flight, and again fell to the ground. Another Weasel came out of his hole and caught him.\n\n"Pray don't kill me," said the Bat.\n\n"Certainly I shall," said the Weasel; "I kill mice wherever I find them."\n\n"But stop a moment," said the Bat, spreading his wings; "I am not a mouse. Don't you see my great wings? A mouse can't fly, can it?"\n\n"I beg your pardon," said the Weasel; "I did not know that you were a bird; I thought you were a mouse. I see I was mistaken." Then he let him go.\n\nSo the cunning Bat escaped a second time, but it is not often safe to use such arguments.

THE FOX AND THE GOAT\n\nA Fox once happened to fall into a deep well. He tried in every way to get out, but at last began to think that it was impossible, and that he must die there, a prisoner. While he was thinking how sad that would be, a thirsty Goat came and looked down into the well, wishing that he could get some water. He soon saw the Fox.\n\n"Halloo," said the Goat, "what are you doing down there? Is the water good?"\n\n"The best I ever tasted," answered the Fox. "It is cool, and clear, and delicious. Come down and try it yourself."\n\n"I will," said the Goat, "for I am nearly dead with thirst."\n\nSo he jumped down, and drank as much water as he wanted.\n\n"Oh, how refreshing!" cried he.\n\n"Yes," said the Fox; "and now, if you have finished drinking, let me ask how you expect to get out of this well again."\n\n"Oh, I don't know," replied the Goat. "How do you expect to get out?"\n\n"That is what I have been wondering about for the last hour," said the Fox, "and have just now thought of a good plan. If you will put your forefeet high up on the wall, I will climb up your back, and so get out, and then, of course, I can help you out."\n\n"Very well," said the Goat, who was a simple creature, "that is a good plan. How I wish I had your brains!" He put his forefeet on the wall, and the Fox easily climbed out and started to go on his way.\n\n"Wait a moment," called the Goat; "you forgot to help me out."\n\n"You foolish fellow!" said the Fox, with a mocking laugh; "you ought to have thought how you would get out, before you jumped down. I fell in, but you went down of your own accord. Look before you leap next time," and off he ran.

THE WOMAN AND HER HEN\n\nA Woman had a Hen that laid an egg every day. The eggs were large, and sold for a good price. The Woman often thought, as she took them to market: "How glad they all are to get my eggs! I could sell as many more just as easily."\n\nIt began to look a small thing to her to get but a single egg each day. "If I were to give a double allowance of barley, the Hen might be made to lay two eggs a day instead of one," she said.\n\nSo she doubled the food, and the Hen grew very fat and sleek; but she stopped laying eggs.

THE DOG IN THE MANGER\n\nA sleepy Dog went to the barn, and jumped into a manger full of hay, curling himself up there for an afternoon nap.\n\nWhen he had been sleeping comfortably for some time, the Oxen came in for their supper.\n\nThe Dog awoke in a great rage at being disturbed, and began to growl and bark at them. He would not let them get at the hay.\n\n"Stop a moment," said one of the Oxen. "Do you want to eat this hay?"\n\n"No," said the Dog; "I shouldn't think of such a thing."\n\n"Very well, then," said the Ox, "we do want to eat it, for we are\nhungry and tired."\n\n"Oh, go away," growled the Dog, "and let me sleep."\n\n"What an ugly, snappish fellow!" said the Ox. "He will neither eat the hay himself nor let us eat it!"

THE MOUSE, THE FROG, AND THE HAWK\n\nA Mouse, who had always lived on the land, and a Frog, who passed most of his time in the water, became friends.\n\nThe Mouse showed the Frog his nest and everything he could think of that was pleasant to see; and the Frog invited the Mouse to go home with him and see all the beautiful things that are under the water.\n\n"Can you swim?" asked the Frog.\n\n"Not much," said the Mouse.\n\n"No matter," said the Frog; "I will tie your foot to my foot with a piece of this strong grass, and then I can pull you along nicely." The Frog laughed as he said this. He thought it would be good fun for him, but he well knew that the Mouse would not enjoy it.\n\nWhen the Frog had tied the Mouse's foot to his own, they started together across the meadow. They soon came to the edge of the water, and the Frog jumped in, pulling the Mouse in with him.\n\n"Oh, how cool and nice the water is, after the dry, hot land!" said the Frog, as he swam gayly about. But the poor Mouse was frightened.\n\n"Please let me go," said he, "or I shall die."\n\n"Oh, never mind," said the unkind Frog; "you will get used to the water. I just love it."\n\nBut soon the poor Mouse was drowned, and floated up to the top of the water, while the Frog frisked about down below.\n\nJust then a Hawk saw the Mouse, and pounced upon it.\n\nAs he flew away with it the Frog was dragged out of the water, too, for he was still tied to the Mouse.\n\n"Stop, stop!" cried the Frog. "Let me go. It is the Mouse you want."\n\n"Come along," said the Hawk; "I want you both. I will eat you first, for I like Frog meat even better than I do Mouse."\n\nIn a few moments the Hawk had made a good supper, and there was nothing left of either the false Frog or the foolish Mouse.

THE SHEPHERD'S BOY AND THE WOLF\n\nA man who had a fine flock of Sheep put them all into a field, and hired a Boy to take care of them, while he worked near by with his Men.\n\nThe Sheep went nibbling the grass all day, up and down the hills and along the brook; and all that the Boy had to do was to look out for the Wolf, and see that he did not come prowling into the field.\n\nAfter a while the Boy began to wish that something would happen, it was so tiresome staying there all alone, with no one to speak to and nothing to do. He wished he could be with the Men in the next field, or that they could come and stay with him. All at once he thought to himself, "I will make them think the Wolf has come. That will be great fun."\n\nSo he called out as loudly as he could, "Help! help! The Wolf!" and all the Men came running up.\n\nWhen they found it was only a joke, they laughed, and went back to their work.\n\nOn the next day the Boy tried the same trick again. As before, the Men dropped their mattocks and spades, for fear there might be danger, and ran to the help of the Boy. He only laughed at them for their pains, and this time they did not relish the joke. Still the Boy did not give it up. Again he shouted "Wolf! Wolf!" till the Men took no notice of him when he called them, no matter how loudly or how long he shouted.\n\nAfter a while, the Wolf did get into the field. Then in real terror the Boy called and called: "Pray do come and help me. The Wolf is killing the sheep. The Wolf! the Wolf!" But no one gave heed to his cries. Finding only a terrified coward in care of the flock, the Wolf left few of them uninjured.

THE FISHERMAN AND THE LITTLE FISH\n\nAll day long a Fisherman had been toiling and had caught nothing.\n\n"I will make one more effort," thought he, "and then I must go home."\n\nHe threw in his line, and soon drew up a very small perch.\n\nThe little Fish was terribly frightened when he found himself out of water, and with a sharp hook sticking in his mouth; and he said to the Fisherman:\n\n"O sir, take pity upon me, and throw me into the water again! See what a little thing I am. I should not make one mouthful for you now; but if you leave me in the water, I shall grow large and stout, and then I shall be worth catching. You can make a dinner of me then, or sell me for a good price."\n\n"Ah!" said the Fisherman, "it is true you are small, but I have you safely now. If I should throw you back, I might never catch you again. You are better than nothing. I will keep you"; and he put the little Fish into his basket, and took him home with him.

THE FOX AND THE CROW\n\nA Crow stole a piece of cheese one day, and flew with it up into a tree, so as to eat it at her leisure.\n\nAs she sat there, holding it in her beak, a Fox chanced to pass by, and looking up saw her. "How good that cheese smells!" thought he; "I'll have it, sure as I'm a Fox."\n\nComing close to the tree, he said, "My dear Madam, what a beautiful creature you are! I was not aware till this moment what rare beauty your family possesses. What eyes! What glossy feathers! What grace of form! Is your voice as charming to hear, as your person is to look upon? If it is, you well deserve to be called the Queen of Birds. Will you not do me the favor to sing to me?"\n\nNow it is well known that the Caw! Caw! of the Crow family is not musical. She ought to have been on her guard, but so delighted was she with the flattery of the Fox that she forgot to be wary. She opened her mouth to show the Fox the sweetness of her voice, whenâ€”down fell the bit of cheese, which was exactly what was expected.\n\nThe Fox ate it at one mouthful, then stopped to say, "Thank you, madam. I am quite satisfied. Your voice is well enough, I have no doubt. What a pity it is you are so sadly wanting in wit!"\n\nThe Crow learned that we do well to be on our guard when people flatter us.

THE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER\n\nA Fowler caught a Partridge, and was just going to kill it.\n\n"Wait a moment," said the Partridge; "don't kill me."\n\n"Why not?" said the Fowler.\n\n"Because I like to live," said the Partridge; "and, besides, if you let me go, I will bring some of my friends and neighbors here, and you can catch them, and that will be better than only one poor bird."\n\n"You are willing, then, that your friends and neighbors should die, to save your own life?" said the Fowler. "Wicked Partridge! you have lived long enough." And he killed it.

THE THREE TRADESMEN\n\nA great city was once besieged, and all its inhabitants were gathered together to consider by what means it might be protected from the enemy.\n\nA Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as the best materials for successful defense.\n\nA Carpenter with equal energy proposed timber as a preferable means of defense.\n\nHearing which, a Currier stood up and said, "Sirs, I differ with you wholly. There is no material for resistance equal to a covering of hides, and nothing in the present case so good as leather."\n\nEvery man for his own trade.

THE HARES AND THE FROGS\n\nIn a forest, deep, shady, and still, there once lived a company of Hares.\n\nWhenever a leaf fell rustling to the ground, or a squirrel, jumping in the branches, broke a twig, the Hares started and trembled, they were so timid.\n\nOne day there came a great wind, rushing through the tops of the trees with a roaring noise, and waving the branches back and forth.\n\nIt frightened the Hares so much that they all started together, running as fast as they could to get out of the forest, which had been their home.\n\n"What a sad state is ours," they said, "never to eat in comfort, to sleep always in fear, to be startled by a shadow, and fly with beating heart at the rustling of the leaves. Better death, by far. Let us drown ourselves in yonder lake."\n\nBut when they came to the lake, it happened that there were scores of frogs sporting on the banks; who, when they heard the sound of footsteps, jumped into the water.\n\nThe timid Hares were startled by the splash; but, as they saw the frogs dive to the bottom of the lake, a wise old Hare said, "Stop a moment! let us consider. Here are creatures that are more timid than weâ€”they are afraid even of us. See, they are drowning themselves for fear of us! It may not be so bad with us as we thought. Perhaps we have been foolish, as foolish as the frogs, who are alarmed when there is no danger. Let us make the best of our lot, and try to be brave in it." So back they went again to the forest.

THE EAGLE AND THE ARROW\n\nA most rapacious Eagle had his eyrie on a lofty rock. Sitting there, he could watch the movements of the animals he wished to make his prey, and, waiting his opportunity, seize them and bear them away.\n\nThe poor creatures had no protection from such a foe. But an archer saw him one day watching, from his place of concealment, the movements of an unsuspicious hare; and, taking aim, he wounded him mortally.\n\nThe Eagle gave one look at the Arrow that had entered his heart, and saw that its feathers had been furnished by himself, when descending to secure prey.\n\n"Ah!" said the Eagle, "it is indeed a double grief that I should perish by an Arrow feathered from my own wing."

THE EAGLE AND THE FOX\n\nOne day a mother Eagle came flying out of her nest to look for food for her babies. She circled round and round, far up in the air, looking down upon the earth with her keen eyes.\n\nBy and by she saw a little baby Fox, whose mother had left it alone while, like the Eagle, she went for food.\n\nDown came the bird, whir went her wings, and away she soared again, with the little Fox clutched fast in her claws.\n\nThe poor mother Fox just at that moment came running home to her child, and saw it being carried away.\n\n"O Eagle!" she cried, "leave me my one little baby. Remember your own children, and how you would feel if one of them should be taken away. Oh, bring back my poor cub!"\n\nBut the cruel Eagle, thinking that the Fox could never reach her, in her nest high in the pine tree, flew away with the little Fox, and left the poor mother to cry.\n\nBut the mother Fox did not stop to cry long. She ran to a fire that was burning in the field, caught up a blazing stick of wood, and ran with it in her mouth to the pine tree where the Eagle had her nest.\n\nThe Eagle saw her coming, and knew that the Fox would soon have the tree on fire, and that all her young ones would be burned. So, to save her own brood, she begged the Fox to stop, and brought her back her little one, safe and sound.

I stir the hearts of men so that when they hear my bold roaring they march out bravely to battle."\n\nThe Vase spoke no words, but gave out a fine, sweet perfume, which filled the air and seemed to say: "I cannot speak, and it is not well to be proud, but I am full of good things that are hidden within me, and that gladly come forth to give cheer and comfort. People are drawn to me in their need, and they remember me afterward with gratitude. But you have nothing in you but noise, and you must be struck to make you give that out. I would not boast so much if I were you."
