Don't change horses in midstream. An Englishman's home is his castle. "Beggars can't be choosers," said Herbert. If you can't bite, don't show your teeth. "Don't mix grapes with the grain" is a famous proverb. Everybody's business is nobody's business. Tell me Thy company, and I'll tell thee what Thou art. Tom remembers: "Jim said, 'You should come to Dallas.'" Old age isn't so bad when you consider the alternative. Man's main task in life is to become what he potentially is.
