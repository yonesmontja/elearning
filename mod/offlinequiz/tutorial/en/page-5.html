<h3>5. Finally...</h3>

<p>Please keep in mind, that the answer forms are interpreted by a computer. This machine can't read
anything you write beside the boxes. For the computer program anything outside the boxes is just a spot that
prevents the machine from interpreting the form correctly. You punish yourself if you don't
place the marks correctly.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
