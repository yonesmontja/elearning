* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation
  automatically.


Documentation

You can find the report in the admin interface in moodle under Administration / Reports / Offlinequiz Cronjob Admin.
When you enter the page you get an interface to search for new/pending/finished jobs. You also have a searchbar to search for users who uploaded the file. By clicking on an ID you have the chance to download the files of the job, resent it or delete it entirely if you had problems with it.


Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we cannot test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-report_offlinequizcron/issues). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a
screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
