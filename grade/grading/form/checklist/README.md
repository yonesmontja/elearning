# Checklist Grading Form
The Checklist advanced grading method is an easy way for the user and teacher to view a 
list of criteria and the associated grade value for each criteria. The Checklist provides 
teachers with a simple way to assign points to a set of criteria for grading any activity
in Moodle that allows the use of advanced grading (currently Activities and Open forums).

Checklists allow the teacher to consistently grade all students on an assignment with the 
same list of criteria, and the same point values for each criteria. Final grades entered the Checklist
are added to the Gradebook.
